/** \mainpage Rehab Tracker

\section Overview
The overarching goal of the project was to create a mobile application/wireless-enabled NMES device to improve rehabilitation compliance of patients with ACL tears through increased monitoring and novel patient-provider interactions. The iOS app connects to the NMES electrotherapy device through bluetooth, and receives data on the rehabilitation session. This data is saved in a database and is viewable to the physician on the physician-portal website. Copyright Â© University of Vermont.
