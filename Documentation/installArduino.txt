\section Install

(Step 1 to 3 are only required at the first time)
1. Install Arduino IDE 1.8.5
	- Go to this link to download Arduino IDE
	- https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
<br><br>
2. Install the blend board to Arduino IDE and install libraries
	- Follow the instruction of installation in the following page
	- https://github.com/RedBearLab/Blend
<br><br>
3. Make sure all used libraries are installed
	- EEPROMex
	- SPI
	- lib_aci
	- aci_setup
	- RBL_nRF8001
	- RBL_services
	- Wire
	- RTClib
<br><br>
4. Open MasterV1.ino in Arduino IDE
<br><br>
5. Use micro-USB to connect the blend board with your laptop
	- There is a hexagonal screwdriver in the bag to open the white part of the device
<br><br>
6. Select Tools menu, then Board, and last Blend
<br><br>
7. Select Tools menu, then Port, and last the port that you connect the micro-USB
<br><br>
8. Make sure Serial Monitor is not open
<br><br>
9. Click the Verify button in the top left corner
	- This is not necessary if you will upload the program to the blend board
<br><br>
10. Click the Upload button next to Verify
	- When there is “Done uploading” shown in the window below the code part, the blend board is running the program

\section recovery Port Not Found
If you do not see the USB port you’re using, try these following steps
Recovery Procedure for Blend Micro sketch upload failing. (https://github.com/RedBearLab/Blend)
1. Open the Blink sketch (File menu -> Examples -> 01.Basics -> Blink)
2. Press the white button on the blend board to reset the board. It will enter to bootloader mode for 8 seconds (the LED - L will be flashing).
3. During this 8-second period, select the COM port of the board in the Arduino IDE (Tools menu -> Port)
4. Press "Compile and Upload" and then press the reset button on the board again. It should be able to load the sketch and fix the issue.


Potential reasons for sketch upload failure:
- Fail to upload a complete sketch last time. (e.g. uploading and suddenly removing power source, then the board's USB will not work since the firmware inside the board is invalid)
- The program uses too much dynamic memory.
