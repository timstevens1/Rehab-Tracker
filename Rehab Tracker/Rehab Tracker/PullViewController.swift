// 12 steps of bluetooth

// (1) Import
// Unlike beacons, which use Core Location, if you are communicating to a BLE device, you will use CoreBluetooth.
import Foundation
import UIKit
import CoreData
import CoreBluetooth

// (2) Delegates
// Eventually you are going to want to get callbacks from some functionality. There are two delegates to implement: CBCentralManagerDelegate, and CBPeripheralDelegate.
class PullViewController: UIViewController, CBCentralManagerDelegate, CBPeripheralDelegate {
    
    //(3) Declare Manager and Peripheral
    // The CBCentralManager install will be what you use to find, connect, and manage BLE devices. Once you are connected, and are working with a specific service, the peripheral will help you iterate characteristics and interacting with them.
    private var manager:CBCentralManager!
    private var peripheral:CBPeripheral!
    var resultString: String!
    private var stats:[(sessionID: String, avg_ch1_intensity:String, avg_ch2_intensity:String, session_compliance: String)] = []
    


    // (4) UUID and Service Name
    // You will need UUID for the BLE service, and a UUID for the specific characteristic. In some cases, you will need additional UUIDs. They get used repeatedly throughout the code, so having constants for them will keep the code cleaner, and easier to maintain.
    let RT_NAME = "RehabTracker"
    let RT_SERVICE_UUID = CBUUID(string: "713D0000-503E-4C75-BA94-3148F18D941E")
