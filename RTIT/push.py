#  \brief Code for sending push notifications (This file is in in RTIT/).
#
#  This code hosted on Uvmâ€™s silk server queries an API file RTIT/getPushNotifications.php to send push notifications. There is an original file Restful/push.py that was written to directly query the database and send push notifications from the Redcap server at the college of medicine. However, we were unable to do this on the Redcap server, so the code in this file is currently used.
#
#  Read the document of Restful/push.py.
#
#  The code on Github is [here] (https://github.com/timstevens1/Rehab-Tracker/blob/master/RTIT/push.py).
