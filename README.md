# Rehab-Tracker
The overarching goal of the project was to create a mobile application/wireless-enabled NMES device to improve rehabilitation compliance of patients with ACL tears through increased monitoring and novel patient-provider interactions. The iOS app connects to the NMES electrotherapy device through bluetooth, and recieves data on the rehabilitation session. This data is saved in a database and is viewable to the physician on the physician-portal website. Copyright Â© University of Vermont.

- **Hardware:**
    - The code for the Blend Arduino that will be uploaded to the board on the NMES machine. There is only one file, Arduino.ino, in this directory.
- **RTIT:**
    - The code for web services including physician web portal and backend database web services.
    - **Restful:** All of the scripts that involve RESTful communication, PUSH notifications, and compliance scripts as well as database architecture.
    - **PhysicianPortal:** The code for the online portal which clinicians can use to add/manage users as well as track compliance and patient sessions.
